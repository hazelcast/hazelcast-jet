# This is a full example hazelcast-jet.yaml that includes all the
# configuration elements and attributes of a Hazelcast Jet member.
#
# To learn how to configure Hazelcast Jet, please see the Reference Manual
# at https://jet.hazelcast.org/documentation/

hazelcast-jet:

  instance:
    # number of threads in the cooperative thread pool
    cooperative-thread-count: 8
    # period between flow control packets in milliseconds
    flow-control-period: 100
    # number of backup copies to configure for Hazelcast IMaps used internally in a Jet job
    backup-count: 1
    # the delay after which auto-scaled jobs will restart if a new member is added to the
    # cluster. The default is 10 seconds. Has no effect on jobs with auto scaling disabled
    scale-up-delay-millis: 10000
    # Sets whether lossless job restart is enabled for the node. With
    # lossless restart you can restart the whole cluster without losing the
    # jobs and their state. The feature is implemented on top of the Hot
    # Restart feature of Hazelcast IMDG which persists the data to disk.
    lossless-restart-enabled: false

  # custom properties which can be read in the user code
  properties:
    custom.property: custom property

  edge-defaults:
    # capacity of the concurrent SPSC queue between each two processors
    queue-size: 1024
    # network packet size limit in bytes, only applies to distributed edges

  metrics:
    # whether metrics collection is enabled
    enabled: true
