    /**
     * A comparison function, which imposes a <i>total ordering</i> on some
     * collection of objects.  Comparators can be passed to a sort method (such
     * as {@link Collections#sort(List, java.util.Comparator) Collections.sort} or {@link
     * java.util.Arrays#sort(Object[], java.util.Comparator) Arrays.sort}) to allow precise control
     * over the sort order.  Comparators can also be used to control the order of
     * certain data structures (such as {@link SortedSet sorted sets} or {@link
     * java.util.SortedMap sorted maps}), or to provide an ordering for collections of
     * objects that don't have a {@link Comparable natural ordering}.
     *
     * The ordering imposed by a comparator <tt>c</tt> on a set of elements
     * <tt>S</tt> is said to be <i>consistent with equals</i> if and only if
     * <tt>c.compare(e1, e2)==0</tt> has the same boolean value as
     * <tt>e1.equals(e2)</tt> for every <tt>e1</tt> and <tt>e2</tt> in
     * <tt>S</tt>.
     *
     * Caution should be exercised when using a comparator capable of imposing an
     * ordering inconsistent with equals to order a sorted set (or sorted map).
     * Suppose a sorted set (or sorted map) with an explicit comparator <tt>c</tt>
     * is used with elements (or keys) drawn from a set <tt>S</tt>.  If the
     * ordering imposed by <tt>c</tt> on <tt>S</tt> is inconsistent with equals,
     * the sorted set (or sorted map) will behave "strangely."  In particular the
     * sorted set (or sorted map) will violate the general contract for set (or
     * map), which is defined in terms of <tt>equals</tt>.
     *
     * For example, suppose one adds two elements {@code a} and {@code b} such that
     * {@code (a.equals(b) && c.compare(a, b) != 0)}
     * to an empty {@code TreeSet} with comparator {@code c}.
     * The second {@code add} operation will return
     * true (and the size of the tree set will increase) because {@code a} and
     * {@code b} are not equivalent from the tree set's perspective, even though
     * this is contrary to the specification of the
     * {@link Set#add Set.add} method.
     *
     * Note: It is generally a good idea for comparators to also implement
     * <tt>java.io.Serializable</tt>, as they may be used as ordering methods in
     * serializable data structures (like {@link TreeSet}, {@link TreeMap}).  In
     * order for the data structure to serialize successfully, the comparator (if
     * provided) must implement <tt>Serializable</tt>.
     *
     * For the mathematically inclined, the <i>relation</i> that defines the
     * <i>imposed ordering</i> that a given comparator <tt>c</tt> imposes on a
     * given set of objects <tt>S</tt> is:<pre>
     *       {(x, y) such that c.compare(x, y) &lt;= 0}.
     * </pre> The <i>quotient</i> for this total order is:<pre>
     *       {(x, y) such that c.compare(x, y) == 0}.
     * </pre>
     *
     * It follows immediately from the contract for <tt>compare</tt> that the
     * quotient is an <i>equivalence relation</i> on <tt>S</tt>, and that the
     * imposed ordering is a <i>total order</i> on <tt>S</tt>.  When we say that
     * the ordering imposed by <tt>c</tt> on <tt>S</tt> is <i>consistent with
     * equals</i>, we mean that the quotient for the ordering is the equivalence
     * relation defined by the objects' {@link Object#equals(Object)
     * equals(Object)} method(s):<pre>
     *     {(x, y) such that x.equals(y)}. </pre>
     *

     * comparison of null arguments, while maintaining the requirements for
     * an equivalence relation.
