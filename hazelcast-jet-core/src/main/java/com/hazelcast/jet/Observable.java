/**
 * Represents a flowing sequence of values. The sequence can be observed
 * by registering {@link Observer}s on it. Observers are able to see
 * all the values that show up in the sequence after they have been
 * registered.
 * <p>
 * Besides new values appearing observers can also observe completions and
 * failure events. Completion means that no further values will appear in
 * the sequence. Failure means that something went wrong during the
 * production of the sequence's values and the event attempts to provide
 * useful information about the cause of the problem.
 * <p>
 * Observable implementations are backed typically by long lived,
 * distributed data objects which get created when the {@link Observable}
 * is {@link JetInstance#getObservable(String) requested from a JetInstance}.
 * <p>
 * Their events are produced by {@link Job}s running
 * {@link com.hazelcast.jet.pipeline.Sinks#observable(String) observable
 * type sinks} and stay alive while their owner jobs keep running. When
 * these jobs are batched by nature and they complete (successfully
 * or with a failure) the observables owned by them remain alive for a
 * preconfigured timeout (see
 * {@link com.hazelcast.jet.core.JetProperties#JOB_RESULTS_TTL_SECONDS
 * JOB_RESULTS_TTL_SECONDS property}, defaults to 7 days) after which they
 * get cleaned up automatically. For streaming jobs no such automatic
 * clean-up is possible, since they never complete, unless they fail.
 * <p>
 * When using {@link Observable}s we encourage their manual cleanup, via
 * their {@link Observable#destroy()} method, whenever they are no longer
 * needed. Automatic clean-up shouldn't be relied upon. Even if a client
 * that has requested the {@link Observable} happens to crash, before
 * managing to do clean-up, it is still possible to manually destroy
 * the backing distributed structures by obtaining a new, identically named
 * {@link Observable} and calling {@link Observable#destroy()} on that.
 * <p>
 * It is possible to use the same {@link Observable} for multiple jobs, or
 * even use the same {@link Observable} multiple times in the same job (by
 * defining {@link com.hazelcast.jet.pipeline.Sinks#observable(String)
 * observable type sinks} with the same name). If done so one should be aware
 * that there will be parallel streams of events which can be intermingled
 * with eachother in all kinds of unexpected ways. It is not possible to
 * tell which events originate from which sink.
