/**
 * Represents a unit of data processing in a Jet computation job. Conceptually,
 * a vertex receives data items over its inbound {@link Edge edges} and pushes
 * data items to its outbound edges. Practically, a single vertex is represented
 * by a set of instances of {@link Processor}. The {@code localParallelism} property
 * determines the number of processor instances running on each cluster member.
 * <p>
 * Each processor is assigned a set of partition IDs it is responsible for. When
 * an inbound edge is <em>partitioned</em>, the processor will receive only those
 * data items whose partition ID it is responsible for. For data traveling over a
 * partitioned edge which is also <em>distributed</em>, the whole cluster contains
 * a single unique processor instance responsible for any given partition ID. For
 * non-distributed edges, the processor is unique only within a member and each
 * member has its own processor for any given partition ID. Finally, there is a
 * guarantee of collation across all the partitioned edges impinging on a vertex:
 * within each member, all the data with a given partition ID is received by the
 * same processor.
 * <p>
 * A vertex is uniquely identified in a DAG by its name.
