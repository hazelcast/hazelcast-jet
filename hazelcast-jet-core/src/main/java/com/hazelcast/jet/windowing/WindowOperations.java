     * @param mapF a function to apply to the item before passing it to the combining
     *             function
     * @param combineF a function that combines a new item with the current result
     *                 and returns the new result
     * @param deductF a function that deducts the contribution of an item from the
     *                current result and returns the new result
     * @param <T> type of the stream item
