     * <p>
     * Each parallel processor that drives your source has its private instance

     * Your function should add some items to the buffer, ideally those it has
     * ready without having to block. A hundred items at a time is enough to
     * eliminate any per-call overheads within Jet. If it doesn't have any
     * items ready, it may also return without adding anything. In any case the
     * function should not take more than a second or so to complete, otherwise
     * you risk interfering with Jet's coordination mechanisms and getting bad
     * performance.
     * <p>
     * Once it has emitted all the data, {@code fillBufferFn} must call {@link
     * SourceBuffer#close() buffer.close()}. This signals Jet to not call {@code
     * fillBufferFn} again and at some later point it will call the {@code
     * destroyFn} on the state object.
     * <p>
     * Unless you call {@link SourceBuilder.Batch#distributed(int) builder.distributed()},
     * Jet will create just a single processor that should emit all the data.
     * If you do call it, make sure your distributed source takes care of
     * splitting the data between processors. Your {@code createFn} should
     * consult {@link Context#totalParallelism()} procContext.totalParallelism()}
