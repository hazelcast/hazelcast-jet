/**
 * Offers a step-by-step fluent API to build a pipeline stage that
 * performs a windowed co-grouping and aggregation of the data from several
 * input stages. To obtain it, call {@link
 * StageWithGroupingAndWindow#aggregateBuilder()} on one of the stages to
 * co-aggregate, then add the other stages by calling {@link #add
 * add(stage)} on the builder. Collect all the tags returned from {@code
 * add()} and use them when building the aggregate operation. Retrieve the
 * tag of the first stage (from which you obtained the builder) by calling
 * {@link #tag0()}.
 * <p>
 * This object is mainly intended to build a co-aggregation of four or more
 * contributing stages. For up to three stages, prefer the direct {@code
 * stage.aggregateN(...)} calls because they offer more static type safety.
