     * {@code 2}).
     * <p>
     * The amount of lag you configure strongly influences the latency of Jet's
     * output. Jet cannot finalize the window until it knows it has observed all
     * the events belonging to it, and the more lag it must tolerate, the longer
     * will it have to wait for possible latecomers. On the other hand, if you
     * don't allow enough lag, you face the risk of failing to account for the
     * data that came in after the results were already emitted.
     * <p>
     * <b>Note:</b> This method adds the timestamps after the source emitted
     * them. When timestamps are added at this moment, source partitions won't
     * be coalesced properly and will be treated as a single stream. The
     * allowed lag will need to cover for the additional disorder introduced by
     * merging the streams. The streams are merged in an unpredictable order
     * and it can happen, for example, that after the job was suspended for a
     * long time, there can be a very recent event in partition1 and a very old
