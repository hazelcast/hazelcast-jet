     * Returns a window definition that aggregates events into session windows.

     * <p>
     * The functioning of session windows is easiest to explain in terms of the
     * <em>event interval</em>: the range {@code [timestamp, timestamp +
     * sessionTimeout)}. Initially an event causes a new session window to be
     * created, covering exactly the event interval. A following event under
     * the same key belongs to this window iff its interval overlaps it. The
     * window is extended to cover the entire interval of the new event. The
     * event may happen to belong to two existing windows if its interval
     * bridges the gap between them; in that case they are combined into one.
     *
     * <h4>Behavior when changing session timeout on job update</h4>
     *
     * It is allowed to change session timeout in an updated pipeline. Windows
     * are stored in the snapshot with the end time equal to the time of the
     * latest event + session timeout. A new event after the update will be
     * merged into the old window using the new timeout. This will cause that
     * the windows after the update will have varying timeouts until all
     * windows from before the update are emitted.
     * <p>
     * For example: say {@code E(n)} is an event with timestamp {@code n} and
     * {@code W(m, n)} is a window with {@code startTime=m} and {@code
     * endTime=n}. Session timeout is 10. We receive {@code E(50)}, we'll store
     * it in a window {@code W(50, 60)}. Then, job is updated and session
     * timeout changes to 20. If we then receive {@code E(45)}, we'll handle it
     * as merging of the restored {@code W(50, 60)} and of {@code W(45, 65)},
     * created from the new event and new timeout. It will result in {@code
     * W(45, 65)}. Thus, the actual session timeout in this window will be 15.
     *
     * @param sessionTimeout the exclusive upper bound on the difference between any two
     *                       successive timestamps included in a window.
