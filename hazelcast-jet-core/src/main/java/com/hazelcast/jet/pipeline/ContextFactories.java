     * If you want to destroy the map after the job finishes, call
     * {@code factory.destroyFn(ReplicatedMap::destroy)} on the object you get
     * from this method.

     * <pre>
     * p.drawFrom( /* a batch or streaming source &#42;/ )
     *  .mapUsingContext(replicatedMapContext("fooMapName"),
     *      (map, item) -> tuple2(item, map.get(item.getKey())))
