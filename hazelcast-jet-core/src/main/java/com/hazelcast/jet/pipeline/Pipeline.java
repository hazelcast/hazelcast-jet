/**
 * Models a distributed computation job using an analogy with a system of
 * interconnected water pipes. The basic element is a <em>stage</em> which
 * can be attached to one or more other stages. A stage accepts the data
 * coming from its upstream stages, transforms it, and directs the
 * resulting data to its downstream stages.
 * <p>
 * The {@code Pipeline} object is a container of all the stages defined on
 * a pipeline: the source stages obtained directly from it by calling {@link
 * #drawFrom(BatchSource)} as well as all the stages attached (directly or
 * indirectly) to them.
 * <p>
 * Note that there is no simple one-to-one correspondence between pipeline
 * stages and Core API's DAG vertices. Some stages map to several vertices
 * (e.g., grouping and co-grouping are implemented as a cascade of two
 * vertices) and some stages may be merged with others into a single vertex
 * (e.g., a cascade of map/filter/flatMap stages can be fused into one
 * vertex).
