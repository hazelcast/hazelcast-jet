/**
 * Represents the function you pass to a windowed aggregation method in the
 * Pipeline API, such as {@link com.hazelcast.jet.pipeline.StageWithWindow#aggregate2
 * stage.aggregate2()}, that aggregates two input streams. It creates the
 * item to emit based on the two results of the aggregate operation
 * performed for a particular window.
 * <p>
 * The parameters are:
 * <ol><li>
 *     {@code winStart} and {@code winEnd}: the starting and ending timestamp
 *     of the window (the end timestamp is the exclusive upper bound)
 * </li><li>
 *     {@code result0} aggregated result of input stream-0
 * </li><li>
 *     {@code result1} aggregated result of input stream-1
 * </li></ol>
 *
 * @param <R0> type of the aggregated result from stream-0
 * @param <R1> type of the aggregated result from stream-1
 * @param <OUT> the type of the output item this function returns
