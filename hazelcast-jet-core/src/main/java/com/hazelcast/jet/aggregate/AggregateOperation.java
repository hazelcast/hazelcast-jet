/**
 * Contains primitives needed to compute an aggregated result of stream
 * processing. The result is computed by updating a mutable result
 * container, called the <em>accumulator</em>, with data from each stream
 * item and, after all items are processed, transforming the accumulator
 * into the final result. The data items may come from one or more inbound
 * streams; there is a separate {@code accumulate} function for each of
 * them.
 * <p>
 * This is a summary of all the primitives involved:
 * <ol><li>
 *     {@link #createFn() create} a new accumulator object
 * </li><li>
 *     {@link #accumulateFn(Tag) accumulate} the data of an item by mutating
 *     the accumulator
 * </li><li>
 *     {@link #combineFn() combine} the contents of the right-hand
 *     accumulator into the left-hand one
 * </li><li>
 *     {@link #deductFn() deduct} the contents of the right-hand
 *     accumulator from the left-hand one (undo the effects of {@code combine})
 * </li><li>
 *     {@link #finishFn() finish} accumulation by transforming the
 *     accumulator object into the final result
 * </li></ol>
 * The <em>deduct</em> primitive is optional. It is used in sliding window
 * aggregation, where it can significantly improve the performance.
 *
 * <h3>Static type design</h3>
 * This interface covers the fully general case with an arbitrary number of
 * contributing streams, each identified by its <em>tag</em>. The static
 * type system cannot capture a variable number of type parameters,
 * therefore this interface has no type parameter describing the stream
 * item. The tags themselves carry the type information, but there must be a
 * runtime check whether a given tag is registered with this aggregate
 * operation.
 * <p>
 * There are specializations of this interface for up to three contributing
 * streams whose type they statically capture. They are {@link
 * AggregateOperation1}, {@link AggregateOperation2} and {@link
 * AggregateOperation3}. If you use the provided {@link
 * #withCreate(DistributedSupplier) builder object}, it will automatically
 * return the appropriate static type, depending on which {@code accumulate}
 * primitives you have provided.
 *
 * @param <A> the type of the accumulator
 * @param <R> the type of the final result
