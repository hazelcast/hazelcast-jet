 * When Jet executes a DAG, it creates one or more instances of {@code
 * Processor} on each cluster member to do the work of a given vertex. The
 * vertex's {@code localParallelism} property controls the number of
 * processors per member.
 * <p>
 * The processor is a single-threaded processing unit that performs the
 * computation needed to transform zero or more input data streams into
 * zero or more output streams. Each input/output stream corresponds to
 * an edge on the vertex. The correspondence between a stream and an
 * edge is established via the edge's <em>ordinal</em>.
 * <p>
 * The special case of zero input streams applies to a <em>source</em>
 * vertex, which gets its data from the environment. The special case of
 * zero output streams applies to a <em>sink</em> vertex, which pushes its
 * data to the environment.
 * <p>
 * The processor accepts input from instances of {@link Inbox} and pushes
 * its output to an instance of {@link Outbox}.
