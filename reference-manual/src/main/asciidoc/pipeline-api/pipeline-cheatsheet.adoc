|Transform s| Sample
|Map
|Apply a mapping function to each input item independently. You can also
do filtering by mapping to `null`.

This example converts the input lines of text to lowercase:
[source]
----
include::{javasource}/CheatSheet.java[tag=s1]
----
|Filter
|Apply a filtering function to each input item to decide whether to
pass it to the output.

This example removes all empty strings from the stream:
[source]
----
include::{javasource}/CheatSheet.java[tag=s2]
----

|Flatmap
|Map each item to arbitrarily many items using a function that returns a
`Traverser` over the result items.

This example splits the lines of text into individual words:
[source]
----
include::{javasource}/CheatSheet.java[tag=s3]
----

|Stateful map
|Transform input into output with access to persistent, mutable state.
Useful for pattern matching and custom rolling aggregation. To reuse
an existing `AggregateOperation`, use `rollingAggregate`.

This example processes a stream of reports on requests completed by a
cluster of servers and emits output whenever it detects a request with
record-breaking latency. If a server is inactive for 2 minutes, it
emits the maximum latency for the server's period of activity that has
just ended and then resets the score for that server:

include::{javasource}/CheatSheet.java[tag=s13]
----

|Distinct
|Suppress duplicate items from a stream. If you apply a grouping key,
two items mapping to the same key will be duplicates. This operation
applies primarily to batch streams, but also works on a windowed
unbounded stream.

This example takes a batch stage with strings and creates a stage with
distinct strings and another where the four-character prefix of the
strings is unique:
[source]
----
include::{javasource}/CheatSheet.java[tag=s11]
----

|Merge
|Merge the contents of two streams into one. The item type in the
right-hand stage must be the same or a subtype of the one in the
left-hand stage.

This example merges the streams from New York and Tokyo stock exchanges:
[source]
----
include::{javasource}/CheatSheet.java[tag=s12]
----

|Enrich by Many-to-One Join
|Perform a many-to-one join with arbitrarily many enriching streams.
The stream on which you invoke `hashJoin` holds foreign keys for
the items in the enriching streams.

This example enriches a stream of stock trades with detailed info on the
stock involved:
[source]
----
include::{javasource}/CheatSheet.java[tag=s4]
----

|Enrich by Map Lookup
|For each stream item, look up a value from a Hazelcast map and
transform (enrich) the item using it. Similar to a hash join with the
map's entry set, but values don't get stale (at the expense of
throughput).

This example enriches a stream of stock trades with detailed info on the
stock involved:
[source]
----
include::{javasource}/CheatSheet.java[tag=s4a]
----

|Aggregate
|Aggregates all the stream items with the `AggregateOperation` you
supply.

This example counts the stream items:
[source]
----
include::{javasource}/CheatSheet.java[tag=s5]
----

|Group and Aggregate
|Group the items by key and perform an `AggregateOperation` on each
group.

This example calculates the number of occurrences of each word in the
stream:
[source]
----
include::{javasource}/CheatSheet.java[tag=s6]
----

|Windowed Group and Aggregate
|Perform grouping and aggregation on an unbounded stream by splitting it
into bounded windows.

This example calculates the number of occurrences of each word in a
stream of tweets within the last second:
[source]
----
include::{javasource}/CheatSheet.java[tag=s7]
----

|Join on Common Key
|Perform a many-to-many join of several streams on a common key.
Apply an `AggregateOperation` on each group. As a special case, you can
specify an aggregate operation that gives you all the joined items
without transformation.

This example joins a "page visits" stream with a "payments" stream in a
Web Shop application. For each user it gives you all the recorded page
views and payments:
[source]
----
include::{javasource}/CheatSheet.java[tag=s8]
----

|Streaming Join on a Common Key
|Like the above, but also apply a window to the unbounded stream. It
joins all the items belonging to the same window.

This example joins two unbounded streams, "page visits" and "payments".
For each user it gives you all the page views and payments that they
performed within the last minute and updates the result every second:
[source]
----
include::{javasource}/CheatSheet.java[tag=s9]
----

|Rolling Aggregation
|Keep performing the same aggregate operation forever, getting the
current result after each item.

This example tracks the largest trade observed in a stream:
[source]
----
include::{javasource}/CheatSheet.java[tag=s10]
----

|Apply a User-Defined Transform
|Modularize and reuse your pipeline code by extracting transforms to
methods.

For example, in this pipeline:
[source]
----
include::{javasource}/CheatSheet.java[tag=apply1]
----

you can extract the `map` and `flatMap` stages to a method:
[source]
----
include::{javasource}/CheatSheet.java[tag=apply2]
----

and then use it like this:
[source]
----
include::{javasource}/CheatSheet.java[tag=apply3]
----

|Transform with Custom Processor
|Add a stage with a custom Core API processor to the pipeline.

Suppose you have this identity-mapping processor:
[source]
----
include::{javasource}/CheatSheet.java[tag=custom-transform-1]
----

Then you can add it to the pipeline this way (suppose you added the
method to the `Util` class:
[source]
----
include::{javasource}/CheatSheet.java[tag=custom-transform-2]
----

Note that the Core API is for advanced use cases and you'll rarely need
it.
