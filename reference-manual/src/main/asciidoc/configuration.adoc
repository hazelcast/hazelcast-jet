= Configuration

In this chapter you can find a reference table listing all the options
to configure Hazelcast Jet as well as information on the different ways
you can set up the configuration: programmatically, declaratively and
from a Spring context.

== Configuration Options

The following tables list and describe all the methods and/or properties
used to configure Hazelcast Jet, grouped by the features they are used
for. Some of the options can also be configured declaratively. See the
<<declarative-configuration, Declarative Configuration section>> for an
example.

[[jet-instance-configuration]]
=== Jet Instance

[cols="1,5a"]
|===
|Configuration API Method|Description

|`setCooperativeThreadCount`
|The number of threads Jet creates in its cooperative multithreading pool.
The default value is `Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors()`.

|`setFlowControlPeriodMs`
|Jet uses a flow control mechanism between cluster members to prevent a
slower vertex from getting overflowed with data from a faster upstream
vertex. Each receiver regularly reports to each sender how much more data
it may send over a given DAG edge. This method sets the duration (in
milliseconds) of the interval between flow-control packets. The default
value is `100` milliseconds.

|`setBackupCount`
|The number of synchronous backups to configure on the IMap that Jet needs
internally to store job metadata and snapshots. The maximum allowed value
is 6 and the default is `1`.

|`setScaleUpDelayMillis`
|The delay after which the auto-scaled jobs restart if a new member joins
the cluster. It has no effect on jobs with auto scaling disabled. The
default value is `10000` milliseconds.

|`setLosslessRestartEnabled`
|Specifies whether the Lossless Cluster Restart feature is enabled. With this
feature, you can restart the whole cluster without losing the jobs and
their state. It is implemented on top of Hazelcast IMDG's Hot Restart
Persistence feature, which persists the data to disk. You need to have
the Hazelcast Jet Enterprise edition and configure Hazelcast IMDG's Hot
Restart Persistence to use this feature. The default value is `false`,
i.e., disabled.
|===

[[fault-tolerance-configuration]]
=== Fault Tolerance

[cols="1,5a"]
|===
|Configuration API Method|Description

|`setProcessingGuarantee`
|Configures the processing guarantee Jet will provide. During normal
cluster operation every item is processed exactly once, but when a
cluster member fails, Jet must stop the jobs, rescale the cluster, and
then resume them. This is where this setting becomes relevant. You can
set this to `NONE`, in which case the job will resume as if it just
started, and `EXACTLY_ONCE` or `AT_LEAST_ONCE` to enable regular
snapshotting of job state that allows it to resume where it left off.
See the {jet-javadoc}/config/ProcessingGuarantee.html[Javadoc] for a detailed
explanation. The default value is `NONE`.

|`setSnapshotIntervalMillis`
|The interval in milliseconds between the completion of the previous snapshot
and the start of a new one. It must be a
positive value and it is only relevant when the processing guarantee is set as either
`EXACTLY_ONCE` or `AT_LEAST_ONCE`.
The default value is set to `10000` milliseconds.

|`setAutoScaling`
|Specifies whether Jet scales the job up or down when a member is added or removed
from the cluster. The default
value is `true`, i.e., enabled.

|`setSplitBrainProtection`
|Specifies whether the split-brain protection feature is enabled. When enabled, Jet
restarts the job after a topology
change, only if the cluster quorum is satisfied. See the
<<split-brain-protection, Split-Brain Protection section>>.
|===

[[performance-configuration]]
=== Performance

[cols="1,5a"]
|===
|Configuration API Method|Description

|`setPacketSizeLimit`
|For a distributed edge, data is sent to a remote member via Hazelcast
network packets. Each packet is dedicated to the data of a single edge,
but may contain any number of data items. This setting limits the size
of the packet in bytes. Packets should be large enough to drown out any
fixed overheads, but small enough to allow good interleaving with other
packets. The default value is `16384`.

|`setQueueSize`
|The capacity of processor-to-processor concurrent queues. The value is
rounded upwards to the next power of 2. The default value is `1024`.

|`setReceiveWindowMultiplier`
|The scaling factor used by the adaptive receive window sizing function.
The default value is `3`.
|===

[[security-configuration]]
=== Security

[cols="1,5a"]
|===
|Configuration Element|Description

|`ssl`
|Allows you to configure the following properties to configure TLS for all member
to member and member to client communications:

* `keyStore`: Path of your keystore file.
* `keyStorePassword`: Password to access the key from your keystore file.
* `keyManagerAlgorithm`: Name of the algorithm based on which the authentication
keys are provided.
* `keyStoreType`: Type of the keystore. The default value is `JKS`. Another commonly
used type is the `PKCS12`. Available keystore/truststore types depend on your Operating
system and the Java runtime.
* `trustStore`: Path of your truststore file. The file truststore is a keystore file
that contains a collection of certificates trusted by your application.
* `trustStorePassword`: Password to unlock the truststore file.
* `trustManagerAlgorithm`: Name of the algorithm based on which the trust managers are
provided.
* `trustStoreType`: Type of the truststore. The default value is `JKS`. Another commonly
used type is the `PKCS12`. Available keystore/truststore types depend on your Operating
system and the Java runtime.
* `mutualAuthentication`: Mutual authentication configuration. It's empty by default
which means the client side of connection is not authenticated. See the
{hz-refman}#mutual-authentication[Mutual Authentication]
section in the Hazelcast IMDG Reference Manual for further details.
* `ciphersuites`: Comma-separated list of cipher suite names allowed to be used. Its
default value contains all the supported suites in your Java runtime.
* `protocol`: Name of the algorithm which is used in your TLS/SSL. The default value is `TLS`.
When you use the default value, your application chooses the TLS version according to your
Java version. So, we recommend you to provide TLS with its version information, e.g., `TLSv1.3`.

You need to have the Hazelcast Jet
Enterprise edition to use this feature. See the <<security, Security chapter>> for
more information.

[[monitoring-configuration]]
=== Monitoring

[cols="1,5a"]
|===
|Configuration Method/Property|Description

|`hazelcast.logging.type`
|The predefined types of built-in logging adapters. Available values are `jdk`, `log4j`,
`log4j2`, `slf4j` and `none`. See the <<configure-logging, Configure Logging section>>.

|`MetricsConfig`
| Allows you to provide the following configuration options for metrics collection:

* `setJmxEnabled`: Specifies whether the metrics are exposed through JMX. The default value
is `true`, i.e., enabled.
* `setRetentionSeconds`: Duration in seconds for which the metrics are retained on the
Jet instance. The default value is `5` seconds.
* `setCollectionIntervalSeconds`: Metrics collections interval in seconds. The default value
is `5` seconds.
* `setMetricsForDataStructuresEnabled`: Specifies whether the data structure statistics are
included in the metrics. The default value is `false`, i.e., disabled.

See {jet-javadoc}/config/MetricsConfig.html[Javadoc] for more information.

2+| You can also use Hazelcast Jet Management Center to monitor your Jet clusters. See the
{jet-mc-refman}[Hazelcast Jet Management Center Reference Manual] for more information.
|===

== Ways to Configure Hazelcast Jet

You can configure Hazelcast Jet both programmatically and
declaratively.

=== Programmatic Configuration

Programmatic configuration is the simplest way to configure Jet. You
instantiate a {jet-javadoc}/config/JetConfig.html[`JetConfig`] and set
the desired properties. For example, the following will configure Jet to
use only two threads in its _cooperative multithreading_ pool:

[source]
----
include::{javasource}/Configuration.java[tag=s1]
----

If you want to specify your own configuration file to create a
`JetConfig`, Hazelcast Jet supports several ways including filesystem,
classpath,`InputStream` and an in-memory string.

Build `JetConfig` from a YAML file:

- `JetConfig cfg = JetConfig.loadYamlFromStream(inputStream);`

- `JetConfig cfg = JetConfig.loadFromClasspath(classloader, yamlFileName);`

- `JetConfig cfg = JetConfig.loadFromFile(yamlConfigFile);`

- `JetConfig cfg = JetConfig.loadYamlFromString(yaml);`

Build `JetConfig` from an XML file:

- `JetConfig cfg = JetConfig.loadXmlFromStream(inputStream);`

- `JetConfig cfg = JetConfig.loadFromClasspath(classloader, xmlFileName);`

- `JetConfig cfg = JetConfig.loadFromFile(configFile);`

- `JetConfig cfg = JetConfig.loadXmlFromString(xml);`


=== Declarative Configuration

If you don't pass an explicit `JetConfig` object when constructing a Jet
instance, it will perform the following lookup procedure:

. Read the system property `hazelcast.jet.config`. If it starts with
`classpath:`, treat it as a classpath resource, otherwise it's a file
pathname. If it's defined but Jet can't find the file it specifies,
startup fails.
. Look for `hazelcast-jet.xml` in the working directory.
. Look for `hazelcast-jet.xml` in the classpath.
. Look for `hazelcast-jet.yaml` in the working directory.
. Look for `hazelcast-jet.yaml` in the classpath.
. Load the default XML configuration packaged in Jet's JAR.

NOTE: The YAML files must have either a `.yaml` or a `.yml`
suffix if they are passed in via `hazelcast.jet.config` property.

Here's an example `hazelcast-jet.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast-jet:
  instance:
    cooperative-thread-count: 8
    flow-control-period: 100
    backup-count: 1
    scale-up-delay-millis: 10000
  properties:
    custom.property: custom property
  edge-defaults:
    queue-size: 1024
    packet-size-limit: 16384
    receive-window-multiplier: 3
----

Here's the same example, but in XML:

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast-jet
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/jet-config hazelcast-jet-config-4.0.xsd"
    xmlns="http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/jet-config"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
    <instance>
       <cooperative-thread-count>8</cooperative-thread-count>
       <flow-control-period>100</flow-control-period>
       <backup-count>1</backup-count>
       <scale-up-delay-millis>10000</scale-up-delay-millis>
    </instance>
    <properties>
       <property name="custom.property">custom property</property>
    </properties>
    <edge-defaults>
       <queue-size>1024</queue-size>
       <packet-size-limit>16384</packet-size-limit>
       <receive-window-multiplier>3</receive-window-multiplier>
    </edge-defaults>
</hazelcast-jet>
----

==== Composing Declarative Configuration

Declarative configurations (both YAML and XML) support the `import`
statement that allows you to compose several configuration snippets into
one final configuration.

Let’s say you want to combine two YAML configurations:
`development-metrics-config.yaml` and `development-instance-config.yaml`.
These two configurations are shown below.

`development-metrics-config.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast-jet:
   metrics:
      enabled: true
      jmx-enabled: true
      collection-interval-seconds: 5
      retention-seconds: 5
      metrics-for-data-structures: true
----

`development-instance-config.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast-jet:
  instance:
    flow-control-period: 100
    backup-count: 1
    scale-up-delay-millis: 10000
    lossless-restart-enabled: false
----

You can write a third file that imports the above two:

[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast-jet:
  import:
    - development-metrics-config.yaml
    - development-instance-config.yaml
----

Here's the same example, but with XML.

`development-metrics-config.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast-jet>
    <metrics enabled="true" jmxEnabled="true">
        <retention-seconds>5</retention-seconds>
        <collection-interval-seconds>5</collection-interval-seconds>
        <metrics-for-data-structures>true</metrics-for-data-structures>
    </metrics>
</hazelcast-jet>
----

`development-instance-config.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast-jet>
    <instance>
        <flow-control-period>100</flow-control-period>
        <backup-count>1</backup-count>
        <scale-up-delay-millis>10000</scale-up-delay-millis>
        <lossless-restart-enabled>false</lossless-restart-enabled>
    </instance>
</hazelcast-jet>
----

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast-jet>
    <import resource="development-metrics-config.xml"/>
    <import resource="development-instance-config.xml"/>
</hazelcast-jet>
----

NOTE: Importing only works on the top level, you can't import nested
snippets.

Hazelcast Jet and Hazelcast IMDG share the same syntax for declarative
configuration composition. For more examples on importing the resources
from the classpath and file system, or resources with variables in their
names, refer to the {hz-refman}#composing-declarative-configuration[relevant section]
in the Hazelcast IMDG Reference Manual.

=== Using Variables
In your Hazelcast Jet declarative configuration, you can use variables
to set the values of the elements. This is valid when you set a system
property programmatically or use the command line interface. You can
use a variable in the declarative configuration to access the values of
the system properties you set.

For example, see the following command that sets two system properties.

```
-Dcooperative.thread.count=16
```

Let's get the values of these system properties in the declarative
configuration of Hazelcast Jet, as shown below.

In the XML configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast-jet>
    <instance>
       <cooperative-thread-count>${cooperative.thread.count}</cooperative-thread-count>
    </instance>
</hazelcast-jet>
----

In the YAML configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast-jet:
  instance:
    cooperative-thread-count: ${cooperative.thread.count}
----

If you do not want to rely on the system properties, you can use the
`XmlJetConfigBuilder` or `YamlJetConfigBuilder` and explicitly set a
`Properties` instance, as shown below.

[source,java]
----
Properties properties = new Properties();

// fill the properties, e.g., from database/LDAP, etc.

XmlJetConfigBuilder builder = new XmlJetConfigBuilder();
builder.setProperties(properties);
JetConfig config = builder.build();
JetInstance hz = Jet.newJetInstance(config);
----

=== Variable Replacers

Hazelcast Jet supports variable replacers which are used to replace
custom strings during loading the configuration.

Hazelcast Jet and Hazelcast IMDG share the same syntax for variable
replacers. You can configure your variable replacers in the Hazelcast Jet
configuration via XML or YAML. Please see the {hz-refman}#variable-replacers[Variable Replacers section]
in the Hazelcast IMDG Reference Manual for more information and examples
on the variable replacers.

== Configure the Underlying Hazelcast Instance

Each Jet member or client has its underlying Hazelcast member or client.
Please refer to the
{hz-refman}#understanding-configuration[Hazelcast IMDG Reference Manual]
for specific configuration options for Hazelcast IMDG.

=== Programmatic

You can configure the underlying Hazelcast IMDG member as follows:

[source]
----
include::{javasource}/Configuration.java[tag=s2]
----

Similarly, you can also configure the underlying Hazelcast client:

[source]
----
include::{javasource}/Configuration.java[tag=s3]
----

=== Declarative

Hazelcast IMDG can also be configured declaratively. Please refer to the
{hz-refman}#configuring-declaratively[Hazelcast IMDG Reference Manual]
for information on how to do this.

== Spring Integration

You can configure and start a Hazelcast Jet instance as a component in
the Spring Application Context. You can use the plain `bean` element
and define individual properties on a `JetConfig` instance, but Jet
provides its own schema-based configuration which will make this much
less verbose.

=== Approach 1: Use the Plain `bean` Element

You can declare Hazelcast Jet objects using the default Spring beans
namespace. Here is an example for a Hazelcast Jet Instance declaration:

[source, xml]
----
<bean id="instance" class="com.hazelcast.jet.Jet" factory-method="newJetInstance">
    <constructor-arg>
        <bean class="com.hazelcast.jet.config.JetConfig">
            <property name="hazelcastConfig">
                <bean class="com.hazelcast.config.Config">
                    <!-- ... -->
                </bean>
            </property>
            <property name="instanceConfig">
                <bean class="com.hazelcast.jet.config.InstanceConfig">
                    <property name="cooperativeThreadCount" value="2"/>
                </bean>
            </property>
            <property name="defaultEdgeConfig">
                <bean class="com.hazelcast.jet.config.EdgeConfig">
                    <property name="queueSize" value="2048"/>
                </bean>
            </property>
            <property name="properties">
                <props>
                    <prop key="foo">bar</prop>
                </props>
            </property>
        </bean>
    </constructor-arg>
</bean>

<bean id="map" factory-bean="instance" factory-method="getMap">
    <constructor-arg value="my-map"/>
</bean>
----

=== Approach 2: Use `jet:instance`

Hazelcast Jet provides its own Spring config schema. Add the namespace
declaration `xmlns:jet=“http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/jet-spring”`
to the `beans` element and then use the *_jet_* namespace prefix.
Make sure you added `hazelcast-jet-spring.jar` to the classpath.

Here's how your namespace and schema instance declarations may look:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xmlns:jet="http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/jet-spring"
       xmlns:hz="http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/spring"
       xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
        http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-2.5.xsd
        http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/spring
        http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/spring/hazelcast-spring-3.12.xsd
        http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/jet-spring
        http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/jet-spring/hazelcast-jet-spring-3.2.xsd">
        <!-- ... -->
 </beans>
----

==== Configuring the Hazelcast Jet Instance

[source,xml]
----
<jet:instance id="instance">
    <hz:config>
        <hz:spring-aware/>
        <hz:group name="jet"/>
        <hz:network port="5701" port-auto-increment="false">
            <hz:join>
                <hz:multicast enabled="false"/>
                <hz:tcp-ip enabled="true">
                    <hz:member>127.0.0.1:5701</hz:member>
                </hz:tcp-ip>
            </hz:join>
        </hz:network>
        <hz:map name="map" backup-count="3">
        </hz:map>
    </hz:config>
    <jet:instance-config cooperative-thread-Count="2"/>
    <jet:default-edge-config queue-size="2048"/>
    <jet:properties>
        <hz:property name="foo">bar</hz:property>
    </jet:properties>
</jet:instance>
----

==== Configure a Jet Client

[source,xml]
----
<jet:client id="jet-client">
    <jet:group name="jet"/>
    <jet:network>
        <hz:member>127.0.0.1:5701</hz:member>
    </jet:network>
    <jet:spring-aware/>
</jet:client>
----

==== Additional Bean Types Supported by the Jet Namespace

You can obtain the underlying `HazelcastInstance` from the Jet instance
as a bean and use it to obtain these Hazelcast IMDG beans:

 - map
 - list
 - multiMap
 - replicatedMap
 - queue
 - topic
 - set
 - executorService
 - idGenerator
 - atomicLong
 - atomicReference
 - semaphore
 - countDownLatch
 - lock

Here are short examples for each of them:

[source,xml]
----
<jet:hazelcast jet-instance-ref="jet-instance" id="hazelcast-instance"/>

<jet:map instance-ref="jet-instance" name="my-map" id="my-map-bean"/>

<jet:list instance-ref="jet-client" name="my-list" id="my-list-bean"/>

<hz:multiMap id="multiMap" instance-ref="hazelcast-instance" name="my-multiMap"/>

<hz:replicatedMap id="replicatedMap" instance-ref="hazelcast-instance" name="my-replicatedMap"/>

<hz:queue id="queue" instance-ref="hazelcast-instance" name="my-queue"/>

<hz:topic id="topic" instance-ref="hazelcast-instance" name="my-topic"/>

<hz:set id="set" instance-ref="hazelcast-instance" name="my-set"/>

<hz:executorService id="executorService" instance-ref="hazelcast-instance" name="my-executorService"/>

<hz:idGenerator id="idGenerator" instance-ref="hazelcast-instance" name="my-idGenerator"/>

<hz:atomicLong id="atomicLong" instance-ref="hazelcast-instance" name="my-atomicLong"/>

<hz:atomicReference id="atomicReference" instance-ref="hazelcast-instance" name="my-atomicReference"/>

<hz:semaphore id="semaphore" instance-ref="hazelcast-instance" name="my-semaphore"/>

<hz:countDownLatch id="countDownLatch" instance-ref="hazelcast-instance" name="my-countDownLatch"/>

<hz:lock id="lock" instance-ref="hazelcast-instance" name="my-lock"/>
----

Hazelcast Jet also supports _lazy-init_, _scope_ and _depends-on_ bean
attributes.

[source,xml]
----
<jet:instance id="instance" lazy-init="true" scope="singleton">
<!-- ... -->
</jet:instance>
<jet:client id="client" scope="prototype" depends-on="instance">
<!-- ... -->
</jet:client>
----

=== Annotation-Based Configuration

Annotation-Based Configuration does not require any XML definition.
Simply create a configuration class annotated with `@Configuration` and
provide a `JetInstance` as a bean by annotating the method with `@Bean`.

[source,java]
----
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

    @Bean
    public JetInstance instance() {
        return Jet.newJetInstance();
    }
}
----

=== Enabling SpringAware Objects

Hazelcast IMDG has a special annotation, `@SpringAware`, which
enables you to initialize the object with spring context.

When a job is submitted to the cluster, processors are created
by Hazelcast Jet on each member. By marking your processor with
`@SpringAware`, you make spring context accessible to your
processor which gives you the ability:

* to apply bean properties
* to apply factory callbacks such as `ApplicationContextAware`, `BeanNameAware`
* to apply bean post-processing annotations such as `InitializingBean`, `@PostConstruct`

You need to configure Hazelcast Jet with `<hz:spring-aware/>`
tag or set `SpringManagedContext` programmatically to enable
spring-aware objects. Code samples for
{jet-examples}/spring/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/jet/examples/spring/XmlConfigurationSample.java[declarative]
and
{jet-examples}/spring/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/jet/examples/spring/AnnotationBasedConfigurationSample.java[annotation-based]
configurations are available at our Code Samples repo.
