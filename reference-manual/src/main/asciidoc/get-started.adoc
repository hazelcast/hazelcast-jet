= Get Started

In this section we'll get you started using Hazelcast Jet. We'll show
you how to set up a Java project with the proper dependencies and a
quick Hello World example to verify your setup.

[[requirements]]
== Requirements

In the good tradition of Hazelcast products, Jet is distributed as a JAR
with no other dependencies. It requires JRE version 8 or higher to run.

== Use Hazelcast Jet as an Embedded Runtime

If you want to use Jet embedded into your existing distributed
application, all you need is a single Jet JAR on your classpath. These
are the Maven and Gradle snippets you can use:

[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
----
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.hazelcast.jet</groupId>
    <artifactId>hazelcast-jet</artifactId>
    <version>{jet-version}</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

[source,groovy,subs="attributes+"]
----
compile 'com.hazelcast.jet:hazelcast-jet:{jet-version}'
----

== Install Jet as a Standalone Cluster

If you are setting up Jet as a standalone cluster, download the
https://jet.hazelcast.org/download[distribution package] of Hazelcast Jet
and use the `bin/start-jet` command to start an instance.

The distribution package contains a ready-made JAR,
`examples/hello-world.jar`, that you can use to run a simple smoke
test. In the base directory of the Jet distribution, type:

[source,bash]
----
$ bin/jet-start &
... wait for Jet to start ...
$ bin/jet submit examples/hello-world.jar
----

If everything works out, you should see this in the log output:

[source]
----
INFO [HelloWorld] [main] - Top 10 random numbers observed so far in the stream are:
----

This uses a simple Jet cluster of size 1, but you can use the same file
to verify your full cluster setup as well. The source code of the example
JAR is
{jet-repo}/examples/hello-world/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/jet/examples/helloworld/HelloWorld.java[
here].

== Install Hazelcast Jet Enterprise (Optional)

Hazelcast Jet Enterprise is a commercial edition of Hazelcast Jet. It's
built on top of Hazelcast Jet open source and extends it with the
following features:

* <<security, Security Suite>>
* Lossless Cluster Restart
* Job Upgrade
* Enterprise PaaS Deployment Environment (Pivotal Cloud Foundry,
   Openshift Container Platform (Jet 3.0))

Hazelcast Jet Enterprise is available on a Hazelcast Maven repository.
Add the following lines to your `pom.xml`:

[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
----
<repository>
   <id>Hazelcast Private Snapshot Repository</id>
   <url>https://repository.hazelcast.com/snapshot/</url>
</repository>
<repository>
   <id>Hazelcast Private Release Repository</id>
   <url>https://repository.hazelcast.com/release/</url>
</repository>
----

[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
----
<dependency>
   <groupId>com.hazelcast.jet</groupId>
   <artifactId>hazelcast-jet-enterprise</artifactId>
   <version>{jet-version}</version>
</dependency>
----

You can download the Hazelcast Jet Enterprise package from
https://hazelcast.com/hazelcast-enterprise-download/[hazelcast.com].

=== Set the License Key

To use Hazelcast Jet Enterprise, you must set the license key using one
of the configuration methods shown below. You can request a trial
license key at https://hazelcast.com/hazelcast-enterprise-download/[hazelcast.com].

Hazelcast Jet Enterprise license keys are required only to run the Jet
cluster. A Jet client can access the Enterprise features without the
license key.

The license key can be configured using one of the following methods:

==== Hazelcast Configuration File

Replace the value for the `<license-key>` tag inside the `hazelcast.xml`
file in the config folder:

[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
----
  <hazelcast ..>
      ...
      <license-key>ENTER LICENSE KEY HERE</license-key>
      ...
  </hazelcast>
----

===== Programmatic Configuration

License key also can be set in the Jet config object as follows:

[source,java]
----
JetConfig config = new JetConfig();
config.getHazelcastConfig().setLicenseKey( "Your Enterprise License Key" );
----

==== System Property

Set the following system property:

----
-Dhazelcast.enterprise.license.key=Your Enterprise License Key
----

=== Hazelcast Jet Management Center

Hazelcast Jet Management Center is a management and monitoring suite
providing a live overview of the Hazelcast Jet cluster. It's a
standalone tool with a web console.

Please see the {jet-mc-refman}[Hazelcast Jet Management Center Reference Manual] for the installation
instructions.

[[verify-your-setup]]
== Write Your First Jet Job

The simple program below processes the contents of a Hazelcast `IList`
that contains lines of text, finds the number of occurrences of each
word in it, and stores its results in a Hazelcast `IMap`. In a
distributed computation job, the input and output cannot be simple
in-memory structures like a Java `List`; they must be accessible to any
member of the computing cluster and must persist after a job ends. This
is why we use Hazelcast structures.

The best way to run this code is by creating a Maven or Gradle project
with Jet as a dependency, and then copying the code below into it.

[source]
----
include::{javasource}/HelloWorld.java[]
----

You should expect to see a lot of logging output from Jet (sent to
`stderr`) and two lines on `stdout`:

[source]
----
Count of hello: 4
Count of world: 5
----

[[java-util-stream]]
== Reuse Your java.util.stream Knowledge

If you've already used Java's Stream API, you'll find many similarities
in Jet's Pipeline API. They both construct a processing pipeline by
adding processing steps (stages). Both are FP-oriented APIs with lambdas
playing a key role. Simple transformations like map/filter even look
exactly the same. The main concern is knowing where the similarities
end. Here are some typical gotchas if the Stream API has set some
expectations for you:

- All lambdas in Jet <<serializable-lambda, get serialized>> so they can
be sent to remote cluster members. If your lambda captures a variable
from the surrounding scope, that variable's contents must be serialized
as well. If you refer to an instance variable, the entire instance
holding it must be serialized. It's quite easy to accidentally capture
and serialize the entire `this` object and everything it refers to.

- The pipeline you construct doesn't execute itself, you must explicitly
{jet-javadoc}/JetInstance.html#newJob-com.hazelcast.jet.pipeline.Pipeline-[submit]
it to a Jet cluster.

- Since you're submitting the computation to an external system, you
don't get the result in the return value of a method call. The pipeline
explicitly specifies where it will store the results (to a
<<pipeline-source-sink, data sink>>).

- Whereas in the Stream API the aggregation is the terminal step, the
one that immediately makes your pipeline execute, in Jet it is just
another transformation (an intermediate step).

Finally, you'll notice that Jet's Pipeline API is much more powerful
than the Stream API. Here are a few highlights:

- <<cogroup, Joining streams>>
- Forking streams (simply do `stage.transform1(); stage1.transform2()`)
- <<windowed-aggregation, Windowed aggregation over infinite streams>>
- <<fault-tolerance, Fault tolerance>>
- <<source-sink-connectors, Connectors to 3rd party systems>>

=== Example: List Transformation

Here's a simple example of list transformation with the Stream API:

[source]
----
include::{javasource}/GetStarted.java[tag=s1a]
----

Here's the equivalent in Jet. Note that we're transforming Hazelcast
`IList` s:

[source]
----
include::{javasource}/GetStarted.java[tag=s1b]
----

=== Example: Grouping and Aggregation

Here's an example of grouping and aggregation with the Stream API. We
compute a histogram of words by their length:

[source]
----
include::{javasource}/GetStarted.java[tag=s2a]
----

And here's how to aggregate in Jet:

[source]
----
include::{javasource}/GetStarted.java[tag=s2b]
----

Note that the result of `aggregate` is just another pipeline stage, you
can apply more transforms to it before draining to the sink.

=== Example: Collector vs. AggregateOperation

If you have ever written your own
{jdk-javadoc}/java/util/stream/Collector.html[Collector] for the
Stream API, you'll find that Jet's <<implement-your-aggregate-operation,
AggregateOperation>> is quite similar and you can transfer your skill
to it.

Here's a Stream API collector that computes the sum of input items:

[source]
----
include::{javasource}/GetStarted.java[tag=s3a]
----

And here's Jet's aggregate operation doing the same:

[source]
----
include::{javasource}/GetStarted.java[tag=s3b]
----

Compared to `Collector`, `AggregateOperation` defines two more
primitives:

- `deduct` reverses a previous `combine`. It's an optional primitive and
serves to optimize sliding window aggregation.
- `export` is similar to `finish`, the difference being that `export`
must preserve the accumulator's state and `finish` doesn't. Jet uses
`finish` wherever applicable as it can be implemented more optimally.
In this example we use the same lambda for both primitives.


== Deploy Using Docker

You can deploy your Hazelcast Jet projects using the Docker containers.
Hazelcast Jet has the following images on Docker:

- Hazelcast Jet
- Hazelcast Jet Enterprise
- Hazelcast Jet Management Center

After you pull an image from the Docker registry, you can run your image
to start the Jet Management Center or a Jet instance with its default
configuration. All repositories provide the latest stable releases but
you can pull a specific release, too. You can also specify environment
variables when running the image.

If you want to start customized instances of Jet or Jet Management Center,
you can extend the the above listed images by providing your own
configuration file. This feature is provided as a Hazelcast Jet plugin.
Please see their own GitHub repos at
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet-docker[Hazelcast Jet Docker]
and
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet-management-center-docker[Hazelcast Jet Management Center Docker]
for details on configurations and usages.

== Deploy Using Kubernetes

Hazelcast Jet provides Kubernetes-ready Docker images which you can
easily deploy into Kubernetes environments. These images use the
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-kubernetes[Hazelcast Kubernetes]
plugin to discover other Hazelcast Jet members in the Kubernetes
environment by interacting with the Kubernetes API.

Using Kubernetes API requires granting certain permissions. Therefore,
you need to create Role Based Access Control definition, (`rbac.yaml`),
with the following content. You can check out the
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-kubernetes[Hazelcast Kubernetes]
plugin for more details on this matter.

Here is the content of `rbac.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: default-cluster
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: view
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: default
  namespace: default
```

You can grant the required permissions stated above using the following
command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f rbac.yaml
```

Then, you need to configure Hazelcast Jet to use Kubernetes Discovery to
discover other members, to do so create a file named
`hazelcast-jet-config.yaml` with the contents as shown below.

Here is the content of `hazelcast-jet-config.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: hazelcast-jet-configuration
data:
  hazelcast.yaml: |-
    hazelcast:
      network:
        join:
          multicast:
            enabled: false
          kubernetes:
            enabled: true
            namespace: default
            service-name: hazelcast-jet-service
```

The following command will create a ConfigMap object in the Kubernetes
Cluster.

```bash
kubectl apply -f hazelcast-jet-config.yaml
```

This object holds our Kubernetes Discovery enabled Hazelcast Jet
configuration. You will use this configuration when you create pods as
explained below.

You need to create a StatefulSet, which manages pods that are based on
an identical container spec, and a Service, which is an abstraction
defining a logical set of pods and a policy using which to access them.
These two should be defined in the (`hazelcast-jet.yaml`) file, as shown
below.

Here is the content of `hazelcast-jet.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: hazelcast-jet
  labels:
    app: hazelcast-jet
spec:
  replicas: 2
  serviceName: hazelcast-jet-service
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: hazelcast-jet
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: hazelcast-jet
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: hazelcast-jet
        image: hazelcast/hazelcast-jet:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        ports:
        - name: hazelcast-jet
          containerPort: 5701
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /hazelcast/health/node-state
            port: 5701
          initialDelaySeconds: 30
          periodSeconds: 10
          timeoutSeconds: 5
          successThreshold: 1
          failureThreshold: 3
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /hazelcast/health/node-state
            port: 5701
          initialDelaySeconds: 30
          periodSeconds: 10
          timeoutSeconds: 1
          successThreshold: 1
          failureThreshold: 1
        volumeMounts:
        - name: hazelcast-jet-storage
          mountPath: /data/hazelcast-jet
        env:
        - name: JAVA_OPTS
          value: "-Dhazelcast.rest.enabled=true -Dhazelcast.config=/data/hazelcast-jet/hazelcast.yaml"
      volumes:
      - name: hazelcast-jet-storage
        configMap:
          name: hazelcast-jet-configuration
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: hazelcast-jet-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: hazelcast-jet
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 5701
```

After creating the (`hazelcast-jet.yaml`) file with the content above,
run the following command to create the Service and StatefulSet:

```bash
kubectl apply -f hazelcast-jet.yaml
```

After that, you can inspect the pod logs to see that they formed a
cluster using the following command:

```bash
kubectl logs hazelcast-jet-0
```

It should output a log similar to the one below:

```bash
....
Nov 15, 2018 9:39:15 AM com.hazelcast.internal.cluster.ClusterService
INFO: [172.17.0.2]:5701 [dev] [0.7]

Members {size:2, ver:2} [
	Member [172.17.0.2]:5701 - d935437e-143e-4e3f-81d6-f3ece16eb23e this
	Member [172.17.0.6]:5701 - 88472d6c-1cae-4b0d-9681-f6da6199bc9c
]
....
```

For more details about deployment and information on how to submit the
Hazelcast Jet jobs to your cluster, see the
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet-docker[Kubernetes Integration] code sample.

== Deployment using Helm

You can deploy Hazelcast Jet using the Helm charts. These charts provide
an easy way to package and deploy applications on Kubernetes.

You can install the chart using the following command:

```bash
helm install stable/hazelcast-jet
```

See the
https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/hazelcast-jet[
Hazelcast Jet Helm Chart] for more details on configuration and the
https://github.com/hazelcast/charts#troubleshooting-in-kubernetes-environments[
Troubleshooting in Kubernetes Environments] section if you encounter any
issues.

In addition to the official Helm charts for Hazelcast Jet, we also
provide Helm charts for
https://github.com/hazelcast/charts/tree/master/stable/hazelcast-jet[
Hazelcast Jet with Management Center]
and
https://github.com/hazelcast/charts/tree/master/stable/hazelcast-jet-enterprise[
Hazelcast Jet Enterprise] on the
https://github.com/hazelcast/charts[Hazelcast Enterprise Helm Chart Repository].

== Scaling the Cluster in Kubernetes

Hazelcast Jet cluster is easily scalable within Kubernetes. You can use
the standard `kubectl scale` command to change the cluster size. See
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/scale-stateful-set/#scaling-statefulsets[
Scaling StatefulSets] for more information.

Note however that, by default, Hazelcast Jet is configured to `TERMINATE`
on receiving the `SIGTERM` signal from Kubernetes, which means that a
container stops quickly, but the cluster's data safety relies on the
backup stored by other Hazelcast Jet members. If you suddenly scale down
by more than your `backup-count` property (1 by default), you may lose
the cluster data.

The other option is to use the `GRACEFUL` shutdown, which triggers the
partition migration before shutting down the Hazelcast Jet member.
Note that it may take some time depending on your data size.

To use graceful shutdown approach, set the following properties:
- `terminationGracePeriodSeconds`:  in your StatefulSet (or Deployment)
configuration; the value defines how much time Kubernetes waits
before terminating the pod and it should be high enough to cover the
data migration process. Default value is 30 seconds
- `-Dhazelcast.shutdownhook.policy=GRACEFUL`: in the JVM parameters
(`JAVA_OPTS` environment variable)
- `-Dhazelcast.graceful.shutdown.max.wait`: in the JVM parameters
(`JAVA_OPTS` environment variable) ; the value should be high enough to
cover the data migration process. Default value is 600 seconds

The graceful shutdown configuration is already included in
https://github.com/hazelcast/charts/tree/master/stable/hazelcast-jet[Hazelcast Jet Helm Chart].

With the <<automatic-elasticity, Automatic Elasticity>> feature, your
jobs will be automatically restarted from the latest known snapshot when
you downscale your cluster. For more details about snapshotting and
processing guarantees see <<fault-tolerance, Fault Tolerance>> section.
