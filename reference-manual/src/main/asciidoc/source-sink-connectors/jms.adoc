= JMS

JMS (Java Message Service) connector can be used both as a source and a
sink for infinite stream processing. The connector is not fault-tolerant.
On job restart it behaves as if you have started a new job. The source
does not do snapshotting, the sink does not suppress duplicate data.

In order to use JMS connector, user should include a JMS Client in
classpath. IO failures are generally handled by JMS Client and do not
cause the connector to fail. Most of the clients offer a configuration
parameter to enable auto-reconnection, refer to client documentation for
details.

== Using JMS as a Source

The JMS source opens a connection to the JMS server for each member.
Then each underlying worker of the source creates a session and a
message consumer using that connection. The user supplies necessary
functions to create the connection, session and message consumer.

The JMS source uses non-blocking API to receive the messages and
transforms each message to a desired output object using supplied
projection function. Source flushes the session after receiving each
message using the supplied flush function.

The following code snippets show streaming messages from a JMS queue
and a JMS topic using ActiveMQ JMS Client.

The JMS topic is a non-distributed source, if messages are consumed by
multiple consumer, all of them will get the same messages. Therefore the
source operates on a single member with local parallelism of 1. Setting
local parallelism to a value other than 1 causes
`IllegalArgumentException`.

== Using JMS as a Sink

The JMS sink opens a connection to the JMS server for each member. Then
each underlying worker of the sink creates a session and a message
producer using that connection. The user supplies necessary functions
and parameters to create the connection, session and message producer.

The JMS sink uses the supplied function to create a `Message` object for
each input item and sends this message using the supplied send function.
After a batch of messages is sent, sink flushes the session using the
supplied flush function.

using ActiveMQ JMS Client.
