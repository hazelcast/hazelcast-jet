Jet accesses data sources and sinks via _connectors_. They are a
computation job's point of contact with the outside world.

= Concerns

Although the connectors do their best to unify the various kinds of
resources under the same "`data stream`" paradigm, there are still many
concerns that need your attention.

== Is it Unbounded?

The first decision when building a Jet computation job is whether it
will deal with bounded or unbounded data. A typical example of a bounded
resource is a persistent storage system, whereas an unbounded one is
usually like a FIFO queue, discarding old data. This is true both for
sources and sinks.

Bounded data is handled in batch jobs and there are less concerns to
deal with. Examples of finite resources are the Hazelcast `IMap`/`ICache`
and the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). In the unbounded category
the most popular choice is Kafka, but a Hazelcast `IMap`/`ICache` can
also be used as an infinite source of update events (via the Event
Journal feature). You can also set up an `IMap`/`ICache` as a sink for
an infinite amount of data, either by ensuring that the size of the
keyset will be finite or by allowing the eviction of old entries.

== Is it Fault-Tolerant?

Can the connector work in a way that even in the case of a job failure
and restart it doesn't miss or duplicate any items it reads or creates?
There are multiple ways this can be achieved:

=== Replayable Source

If a source has a notion of item offset and a reader can seek to an
offset and read the exactly same data from it multiple times, we say
it's replayable. For finite sources it's feasible to restart from offset
0, such as re-read a file. However, an infinite data source may be of
such nature that it can be consumed only once. An example is the TCP
socket connector. Such sources are not fault-tolerant: if anything goes
wrong during the computation, it cannot be retried. Examples of
unbounded replayable sources are Hazelcast Event Journal or Kafka.

=== Consumption Acknowledgements

If a consumer has to acknowledge each processed message and
non-acknowledged messages are redelivered, it's possible to create a
fault-tolerant source. An example of this is the JMS source.

=== XA Transactions

Two-phase transactions are another way to achieve fault-tolerance. Jet
can use the standard X/Open XA Transactions or equivalent API, such as
the one of Apache Kafka.

=== Idempotent writes

An operation is idempotent if, even if executed multiple times, the end
result is the same as if executed just once. If a sink is idempotent and
the job restarts and repeats some writes, the duplicate writes will have
no effect. An example is an IMap sink, but only if the keys are unique
and deterministic.

== Is it Distributed?

A source is distributed if it can be read by multiple readers and each
will get a part of the data. We don't discuss sinks here as practically
all targets can be written to by multiple writers. It also doesn't
matter whether the resource actually stores data in multiple nodes.

A distributed computation engine prefers to work with distributed data
resources. If the resource is not distributed, one Jet member has to do
all the reading and then split the data for other members. Kafka, HDFS,
`IMap` and `ICache` are all distributed. On the other hand, an `IList`
is not: it resides on a single member. When used as a source, only one
Jet member pulls its data.

A <<file-sources, file>> source/sink operating in local mode is a sort
of a "manually distributed" resource, each member accessing its own
local filesystem. You have to manually arrange the files so that on each
member there is a subset of the full dataset. When used as a sink, you
have to manually gather all the pieces that Jet created. The file
source/sink can also operate in shared mode, accessing a shared
filesystem mounted as a local directory.

=== What about Data Locality?

If you're looking to achieve record-breaking throughput for your
application, you'll have to think carefully how close you can deliver
your data to the location where Jet will consume and process it. For
example, if your source is HDFS, you should align the topologies of the
Hadoop and Jet clusters so that each machine that hosts an HDFS member
also hosts a Jet member. Jet will automatically figure this out and
arrange for each member to consume only the slice of data stored
locally.

If you're using `IMap`/`ICache` as data sources, you have two basic
choices: have Jet connect to a Hazelcast IMDG cluster, or use Jet itself
to host the data (since a Jet cluster is at the same time a Hazelcast
IMDG cluster). In the second case Jet will automatically ensure a
data-local access pattern, but there's a caveat: if the Jet job causes
an error of unrestricted scope, such as `OutOfMemoryError`, it will have
unpredictable consequences for the state of the whole Jet member,
jeopardizing the integrity of the data stored on it.

= Overview of Sources and Sinks

The table below gives you a high-level overview of the source and
sink connectors we deliver with Jet. There are links to Javadoc and
code samples. The sections following this one present each connector
in more detail.

The https://jet.hazelcast.org/connectors/[Jet Connector Hub]
contains the complete connector list including the connectors that
aren't packaged with Jet.
