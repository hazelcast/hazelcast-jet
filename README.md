## Hazelcast Jet

[Hazelcast Jet](http://jet.hazelcast.org) is a distributed computing
platform built for high-performance stream processing and fast batch
processing. It embeds Hazelcast In Memory Data Grid (IMDG) to provide
a lightweight package of a processor and a scalable in-memory storage.

Visit [jet.hazelcast.org](http://jet.hazelcast.org) to learn more
about the architecture and use-cases.

### Features:

* Low latency and distributed general data processing framework with
high throughput.
* Highly parallel and distributed stream and batch processing of data.
* Distributed java.util.stream API support for Hazelcast data
structures such as IMap and IList.
* Connectors allowing high-velocity ingestion of data from Apache
Kafka, HDFS, Hazelcast IMDG, sockets and local data files (such as
logs or CSVs)
* API for custom connectors
* Dynamic node discovery for both on-premise and cloud deployments.
* Virtualization support and resource management via Docker, Apache
jclouds, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Consul, Heroku,
Kubernetes, Pivotal Cloud Foundry and Apache ZooKeeper.
