## Hazelcast Jet

[Hazelcast Jet](http://jet.hazelcast.org) is a distributed computing
platform built for high-performance stream processing and fast batch
processing. It embeds Hazelcast In-Memory Data Grid (IMDG) to provide
a lightweight, simple-to-deploy package that includes scalable
in-memory storage.

Visit [jet.hazelcast.org](http://jet.hazelcast.org) to learn more
about the architecture and use cases.

### Features:

* Low-latency, high-throughput distributed data processing framework.
* Highly parallel and distributed stream and batch processing of data.
* Connectors allowing high-velocity ingestion of data from Apache
Kafka, HDFS, Hazelcast IMDG, sockets and local data files (such as
logs or CSVs).
* API for custom connectors.
* Dynamic node discovery for both on-premise and cloud deployments.
* Cloud Native - with available [Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/) 
and [Kubernetes support](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet-code-samples/tree/master/integration/kubernetes)
including Helm Charts.

### Hello World

#### Batch Example

```java
// create a Jet node
JetInstance jet = Jet.newJetInstance();

// create a distributed map and put some data
IMap<Integer, String> lines = jet.getMap("bookLines");
lines.put(0, "It was the best of times");
lines.put(1, "it was the worst of times");
lines.put(2, "it was the age of wisdom");
lines.put(3, "it was the age of foolishness");
lines.put(4, "it was the epoch of belief");

Pipeline p = Pipeline.create();

Pattern delimiter = Pattern.compile("\\W+");

// minimal word count
p.drawFrom(Sources.map(lines))
        .flatMap(e -> traverseArray(delimiter.split(e.getValue().toLowerCase())))
        .filter(word -> !word.isEmpty())
        .groupingKey(wholeItem())
        .aggregate(counting())
        .drainTo(Sinks.map("counts"));

jet.newJob(p).join();

System.out.println(jet.getMap("counts").entrySet());
```

#### Streaming Example

```java
// enable event journal
JetConfig config = new JetConfig();
config.getHazelcastConfig()
        .addEventJournalConfig(new EventJournalConfig().setMapName("bookLines"));
// create a Jet node
JetInstance jet = Jet.newJetInstance(config);

// create a distributed map, we will put some data to stream later on
IMap<Integer, String> lines = jet.getMap("bookLines");

Pipeline p = Pipeline.create();

Pattern delimiter = Pattern.compile("\\W+");

// minimal streaming word count
p.drawFrom(Sources.mapJournal(lines, JournalInitialPosition.START_FROM_OLDEST))
        .withIngestionTimestamps()
        .setLocalParallelism(1)
        .flatMap(e -> traverseArray(delimiter.split(e.getValue().toLowerCase())))
        .filter(word -> !word.isEmpty())
        .groupingKey(wholeItem())
        .window(WindowDefinition.tumbling(TimeUnit.SECONDS.toMillis(1)))
        .aggregate(counting())
        .drainTo(Sinks.logger());

jet.newJob(p);

lines.put(0, "It was the best of times");
Thread.sleep(500);
lines.put(1, "it was the worst of times");
Thread.sleep(500);
lines.put(2, "it was the age of wisdom");
Thread.sleep(500);
lines.put(3, "it was the age of foolishness");
Thread.sleep(500);
lines.put(4, "it was the epoch of belief");
Thread.sleep(500);
lines.put(5, "it was the epoch of incredulity");
Thread.sleep(500);
```

### Building From Source

Pull the latest commits from GitHub (`git pull`) and use Maven to
build (`mvn clean install`). This will also run all the checks and
tests: Checkstyle, FindBugs, and JUnit tests.

Java 8 and Java 9 are supported. 

Maven version 3.5.2 is the minimum version required.
