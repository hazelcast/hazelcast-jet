** Hazelcast Jet 4.2 **

* Generic Debezium-Jet connector and its MySQL & Postgres versions have
  been wrapped with a proprietary API to make them more convenient to
  use and more production-ready.

** Hazelcast Jet 4.1 **

* You can now use our JMS and JDBC sinks with the exactly-once guarantee.
* We simplified adding classes to the Jet job configuration object. You
  can add a whole package in one call and, for `jobConfig.addClass`, we
  automatically add all the class's nested classes, including anonymous
  ones.
* We made the serialization setup simpler. You can now register custom
  serializers with the job and we added extra convenience for protobuf
  serialization.
* We added a `ServiceFactory` that accesses an external gRPC service. You
  can now use `mapUsingService` to transform the data by calling either
  a unary or a bidirectional streaming gRPC service.
* We added the `innerHashJoin` transform that achieves an inner join
  directly instead of requiring custom code in the `mapToOutputFn`. Credit
  for this one goes to @TomaszGaweda.


** Hazelcast Jet 4.0 **

* Updated Hazelcast IMDG version to 4.0, which brings many new features
  such as a revamped metrics system, improved performance.
* Jet now supports calling user-defined Python function from within a
  pipeline using the mapUsingPython transform.
* Snapshots now offer support for distributed two-phase commit (2PC),
  which enables end-to-end exactly-once processing support for sinks and
  sources such as JMS and files.
* Clients can now collect the results of jobs they have submitted via
  Rx-style Observables.
* Users can now add custom metrics to their Pipelines.
* The distribution has been improved with support for daemon mode and
  rolling file based logging.
* Snapshot statistics (keys & bytes saved) and job lifecycle-statistics
  (no. of jobs submitted, terminated and so on) can be tracked via
  metrics now.
* Debezium-Jet connector is now available in hazelcast-jet-contrib. The
  connector makes it possible to stream changes from a database into Jet,
  also known as Change Data Capture (CDC).
* A Kafka Connect adapter is added which enables using any Kafka Connect
  source inside Jet.
* It is now possible to specify the main class when submitting jobs from
  CLI.
* [Jet Enterprise] Jet clients have improved support for failover
  through the use of a blue/green client.

** Hazelcast Jet 3.2 **

* New stateful mapping/flat-mapping and filtering operators allows
  possibility for advanced stateful computation such as custom windows
  and pattern matching.
* New test sources and assertion sinks to help with unit testing of
  pipelines.
* Job-specific metrics are now available via Job API and it's also
  possible to store and query the final metrics for completed jobs.
* New S3 source and sink which can be used to read from and write to
  Amazon Web Services S3 buckets.
* IMap sources and sinks have been rewritten to make better use of
  cooperative multi-threading, resulting in significantly increased
  performance.
* Various job lifecycle improvements to allow small batch jobs to run
  with less latency.
* Updated Hazelcast IMDG version to 3.12.3.

  compatible in further minor versions. Core API will only be compatible
  between patch versions.

    completed
* Being able to atomically create a job only if it's not already running
  using JetInstance.newJobIfAbsent
* [Jet Enterprise] Support for job upgrades and A/B testing via taking a
  named snapshot and then starting the job from the saved snapshot.
* [Jet Enterprise] Being able to restart the whole cluster and restoring
  jobs by using IMDG Hot Restart to persist the cluster to disk
* New Jet Command Line Interface for job management of a cluster
* Support for improved Watermark diagnostics in Jet Management Center
* Support for showing map stats in Jet Management Center
* Full support for JDK 11
* Update Hazelcast version to 3.12
