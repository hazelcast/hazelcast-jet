# Hazelcast Jet Code Samples

A repository of code samples for Hazelcast Jet. The samples show you how
to use the Pipeline API to solve a range of use cases, how to integrate
Jet with other systems and how to connect to various data sources (both
from a Hazelcast IMDG and 3rd-party systems). There is also a folder with
samples using the Core API.

## Stream Aggregation

### [Sliding Window](sliding-windows/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/jet/examples/slidingwindow/StockExchange.java)
  - apply a sliding window
  - perform basic aggregation (counting)
  - print the results on the console

### [Sliding Window with Nested Aggregation](sliding-windows/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/jet/examples/slidingwindow/TopNStocks.java)
  - like the above, plus:
  - add a second-level aggregation stage to find top/bottom N results

### [Session Window](session-windows/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/jet/examples/sessionwindow/SessionWindow.java)
  - apply a session window
  - use a custom Core API processor as the event source
  - perform a composite aggregate operation (apply two aggregate functions
    in parallel).
  - print the results on the console

### [Early Window Results](early-window-results/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/jet/examples/earlyresults/TradingVolumeOverTime.java)
  - use the `SourceBuilder` to create a mock source of trade events from a
    stock market
  - apply a tumbling window, configure to emit early results
  - aggregate by summing a derived value
  - present the results in a live GUI chart

### [Pattern Matching](pattern-matching/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/jet/examples/patternmatching/TransactionTracking.java)
  - use _stateful mapping_ on an event stream to track the state of many
    concurrent transactions, detect when a transaction is done, and compute
    its duration
  - open a GUI window that shows the transaction status

### [Rolling Aggregation](rolling-aggregation/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/jet/examples/rollingaggregation/TradingVolume.java)
  - use `SourceBuilder` to create a mock source of trade events from a stock
    market
  - simple rolling aggregation (summing the price)
  - keep updating the target map with the current values of aggregation
  - present the results in a live GUI chart

## Batch Aggregation

### [Word Count](wordcount/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/jet/examples/wordcount/WordCount.java)
  - use an `IMap` as the data source
  - stateless transforms to clean up the input (flatMap + filter)
  - perform basic aggregation (counting)
  - print a table of the most frequent words on the console using an `Observable`

### [Inverted Index with TF-IDF Scoring](tf-idf/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/jet/examples/tfidf/TfIdf.java)
  - serialize a small dataset to use as side input
  - fork a pipeline stage into two downstream stages
  - stateless transformations to clean up input
  - count distinct items
