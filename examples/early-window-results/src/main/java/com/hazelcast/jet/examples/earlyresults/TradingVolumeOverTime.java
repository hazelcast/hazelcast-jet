/**
 * Showcases the Early Window Results feature of the Pipeline API.
 * <p>
 * The sample Jet pipeline uses a mock data source that generates random
 * trade events. The source also simulates the disorder in the event stream,
 * so some events come on time and some are late by up to five seconds.
 * <p>
 * The pipeline calculates for each 2-second period the total amount of
 * money that changed hands over that period. Since there's disorder in the
 * event stream, the final result for a given time period becomes known
 * only after a five-second delay.
 * <p>
 * We want to see some results immediately, even if incomplete, so we
 * enable early result emission on Jet's windowing operator. With this
 * change, Jet will keep emitting the current incomplete results as the
 * events are still coming in.
 * <p>
 * The sample also starts a GUI window that visualizes the progress of
 * early results gradually becoming complete. Each bar in the chart
 * represents a two-second window, so with the disorder of 5 seconds,
 * there are three to four bars rising at any point in time.
