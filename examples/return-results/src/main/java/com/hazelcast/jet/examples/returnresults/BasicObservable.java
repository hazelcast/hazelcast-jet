/**
 * Demonstrates the usage of observable results on client side in most
 * basic form (similar to Reactive Java Observers & Observables). The biggest
 * advantage of this form is that it's applicable to both batch and streaming
 * jobs, as illustrated here.
 * <p>
 * The concrete job we are observing produces a simple stream of random
 * numbers, from which we compute the top N for each one second tumbling window.
 * <p>
 * The results observed are ordered lists of the top N numbers and are printed
 * once for each window, as they become available.
