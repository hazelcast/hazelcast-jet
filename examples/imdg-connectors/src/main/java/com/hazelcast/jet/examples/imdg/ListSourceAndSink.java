/**
 * Demonstrates the usage of Hazelcast IList as source and sink with the
 * Pipeline API. It takes the contents of a list of integers, maps them to
 * strings, and dumps the results into another list. You may notice that
 * the items in the destination list are disordered &mdash; this is due to
 * the parallelism of the mapping pipeline. If you comment it out, the order
 * will be preserved.
