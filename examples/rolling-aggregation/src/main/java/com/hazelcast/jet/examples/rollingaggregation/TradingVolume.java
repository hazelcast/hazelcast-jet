/**
 * Showcases the Rolling Aggregation operator of the Pipeline API.
 * <p>
 * The sample Jet pipeline uses a mock data source that generates random
 * trade events. It calculates for each stock the rolling sum of the amount
 * of stock that changed hands trading it (i.e., the current traded volume
 * on that stock). The sample also starts a GUI window that visualizes the
 * rising traded volume of all stocks.
