    /**
     * Returns a source that consumes one or more Apache Kafka topics and emits
     * items from them as {@code Map.Entry} instances.
     * <p>
     * The source creates a {@code KafkaConsumer} for each {@link
     * com.hazelcast.jet.core.Processor processor} instance using the supplied
     * {@code properties}. It assigns a subset of Kafka partitions to each of
     * them using manual partition assignment (it ignores the {@code group.id}
     * property). Default local parallelism for this processor is 2 (or less
     * if less CPUs are available).
     * <p>
     * If snapshotting is enabled, partition offsets are saved to the snapshot.
     * After restart, the source emits the events from the same offset.
     * <p>
     * If snapshotting is disabled, the source commits the offsets to Kafka
     * using {@link org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.KafkaConsumer#commitSync()
     * commitSync()}. Note however that offsets can be committed before or
     * after the event is fully processed.
     * <p>
     * If you add Kafka partitions at run-time, consumption from them will
     * start after a delay, based on the {@code metadata.max.age.ms} Kafka
     * property. Note, however, that events from them can be dropped as late if
     * the allowed lag is not enough.
     * <p>
     * The processor completes only in the case of an error or if the job is
     * cancelled. IO failures are generally handled by Kafka producer and
     * do not cause the processor to fail.
     * Kafka consumer also does not return from {@code poll(timeout)} if the
     * cluster is down. If {@link
     * com.hazelcast.jet.config.JobConfig#setSnapshotIntervalMillis(long)
     * snapshotting is enabled}, entire job might be blocked. This is a known
     * issue of Kafka (KAFKA-1894).
     * Refer to Kafka documentation for details.
     * <p>
     * Default local parallelism for this processor is 4 (or less if less CPUs
     * are available). Note that deserialization is done inside {@code
     * KafkaConsumer}. If you have high traffic, the deserialization might
     * become a bottleneck - increase the local parallelism or use {@code
     * byte[]} for messages and deserialize manually in a subsequent mapping
     * step.
     *
     * @param properties   consumer properties broker address and key/value deserializers
     * @param projectionFn function to create output objects from the Kafka record.
     *                     If the projection returns a {@code null} for an item, that item
     *                     will be filtered out.
