    /**
     * Returns a source that consumes one or more Apache Kafka topics and emits
     * items from them as {@code Map.Entry} instances.
     * <p>
     * The source creates a {@code KafkaConsumer} for each {@link Processor}
     * instance using the supplied {@code properties}. It assigns a subset of
     * Kafka partitions to each of them using manual partition assignment (it
     * ignores the {@code group.id} property). Default local parallelism for
     * this processor is 2 (or less if less CPUs are available). The Kafka's
     * message timestamp will be used as a {@linkplain
     * StreamSourceStage#withNativeTimestamps(long) native timestamp}.
     * <p>
     * If snapshotting is enabled, partition offsets are saved to the snapshot.
     * After a restart, the source emits the events from the same offsets.
     * <p>
     * If you start a new job from an exported state, you can change the source
     * parameters as needed:<ul>
     *     <li>if you add a topic, it will be consumed from the default position
     *     <li>if you remove a topic, restored offsets will be ignored (there
     *     will be a warning logged)
     *     <li>if you connect to another cluster, the offsets will be used based
     *     on the equality of the topic name. To avoid this, give different
     *     {@linkplain Stage#setName name} to this source
     *     <li>if the partition count is lower after a restart, the extra
     *     offsets will be ignored
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * If and only if snapshotting is disabled, the source commits the offsets
     * to Kafka using {@link KafkaConsumer#commitSync()}. Note however that
     * offsets can be committed before or after the event is fully processed.
     * You can configure {@code group.id} in this case.
     * <p>
     * If you add Kafka partitions at run-time, consumption from them will
     * start after a delay, based on the {@code metadata.max.age.ms} Kafka
     * property. Note, however, that events from them can be dropped as late if
     * the allowed lag is not large enough.
     * <p>
     * The processor never completes, it can only fail in the case of an error.
     * However, IO failures are generally handled by Kafka producer and do not
     * cause the processor to fail. Kafka consumer also does not return from
     * {@code poll(timeout)} if the cluster is down. If {@link
     * JobConfig#setSnapshotIntervalMillis(long) snapshotting is enabled},
     * entire job might be blocked. This is a known issue of Kafka
     * (KAFKA-1894). Refer to Kafka documentation for details.
     * <p>
     * Default local parallelism for this processor is 4 (or less if less CPUs
     * are available). Note that deserialization is done inside {@code
     * KafkaConsumer}. If you have high traffic, the deserialization might
     * become a bottleneck - increase the local parallelism or use {@code
     * byte[]} for messages and deserialize manually in a subsequent mapping
     * step.
     *
     * @param properties consumer properties broker address and key/value
     *                  deserializers
     * @param projectionFn function to create output objects from the Kafka record.
     *                    If the projection returns a {@code null} for an item,
     *                    that item will be filtered out.
