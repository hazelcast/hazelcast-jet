## Pipeline API

Jet's main API is called the Pipeline API. You can find detailed
information about it inside the Jet Reference Manual.

The content in the reference manual will eventually be moved to this
website, though this is currently a work in progress.

## Javadoc

Jet also contains extensive Javadoc about each public API and should be
consulted first as the primary source of information regarding specific
details of the API.
