Welcome to Hazelcast Jet!

Hazelcast Jet allows you to write modern Java code that focuses purely
on data transformation while it does all the heavy lifting of getting
the data flowing and computation running across a cluster of nodes. It
supports working with both bounded (batch) and unbounded data
(streaming).

These are some of the concerns Jet handles well:

* **Distributed**: Parallize a computation across all CPU cores and
  cluster nodes
* **Scaling**: Scale up to newly added nodes and recover from nodes that
  left or failed
* **Correctness guarantees**: at-least-once and exactly-once processing
  in the face of node failures

Jet integrates out of the box with many popular data storage systems
such as *Apache Kafka*, *Hadoop*, *relational databases*, *message
queues* and many more.

Jet supports a rich set of data transformations, such as
[windowed aggregations](tutorials/windowing.md). For example, if your
data is GPS location reports, you can find the velocity by using a
*sliding window* with just a few lines of code.

Jet also comes with a fully-featured, in-memory key-value store. Use it
to cache results, store reference data or as a data source itself.
