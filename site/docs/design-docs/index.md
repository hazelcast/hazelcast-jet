description: Various Design Documents for Hazelcast Jet features
---

In this section we'll reference technical design of upcoming Jet
features. These documents are evolving over time, and once the
feature is released the documentation will be added as part of the
main docs structure.

Each document is numbered, though since we're just starting this process
we'll only include features for Jet starting from Jet 4.1.
