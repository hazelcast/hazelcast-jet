## SELECT statement

### Synopsis

```sql
SELECT [ ALL | DISTINCT ] [ * | expression [ [ AS ] expression_alias ] [, ...] ]
FROM [schema_name.]table_name [ [ AS ] table_alias ]
[ WHERE condition ]
[ GROUP BY { expression | expression_index } [, ...] ]
[ HAVING condition [, ...] ]
```

The clauses above are standard SQL clauses. The `table_name` is a
mapping name, either as created using [DDL](01-ddl.md) or one created
automatically for non-empty IMaps.

Jet supports all operators and functions supported by IMDG. Go to the
[chapter on SQL](https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/{imdg-version}/manual/html-single/index.html#sql)
in the Hazelcast IMDG reference manual for the full reference.

### Aggregation functions

Jet supports these aggregate functions:

| Name<img width='350'/> | Description |
|--|--|
|`COUNT(*)` :: `BIGINT` | Computes the number of input rows. |
|`COUNT(any)` :: `BIGINT` | Computes the number of input rows in which the input value is not null. |
|`SUM(BIGINT)` :: `BIGINT`<br>`SUM(DECIMAL)` :: `DECIMAL`<br>`SUM(DOUBLE)` :: `DOUBLE` | Computes the sum of the non-null input values. |
|`AVG(DECIMAL)` :: `DECIMAL`<br>`AVG(DOUBLE)` :: `DOUBLE` | Computes the average (arithmetic mean) of all the non-null input values. |
|`MIN(any)` :: _same as input_ | Computes the minimum of the non-null input values. Applicable also to OBJECT type, if the underlying value is `java.lang.Comparable` |
|`MAX(any)` :: _same as input_ | Computes the maximum of the non-null input values. Applicable also to OBJECT type, if the underlying value is `java.lang.Comparable` |

Except for `COUNT`, the functions return NULL when there were no rows to
aggregate. They cannot be applied to streaming inputs: they need to
accumulate the whole of input to produce some results, but a streaming
input has no end. Currently, aggregate functions can't be used for data
coming from IMaps, either, because Jet doesn't currently support reading
from IMaps.

You can prepend `DISTINCT` to the argument of any aggregate function in
order to supply only the distinct values to it. In the case of
`MIN`/`MAX` this makes no difference and the keyword is ignored. For
example, this query calculates the number of distinct colors of cars in
the table:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT color)
FROM cars
```

#### Memory considerations

While computing an aggregate function over records grouped by a key, Jet
must store the aggregation state of all the groups at the same time. If
you use the `DISTINCT` keyword, it must also store all the distinct
values. Jet currently does not have any memory management. If the number
of groups in the result is large, it can lead to an `OutOfMemoryError`,
after which the cluster might be unusable. One technique to reduce the
memory needs is to arrange for the input stream to be sorted by the
grouping key: then you can store the aggregation state of just one key
at a time. Once we add agregate functions to the default SQL engine, we
will leverage this optimization.

### Isolation level

Every connector underlying a table used in the query declares the
isolation level it provides. In general it's _read-committed_. One
aspect of this mode is that it doesn't prevent reading different
versions of a single row while executing a single query. In streaming
mode this behavior is even desired: for example, if you join a record
from an IMap to rows from a Kafka topic, this query can run for months
and you want to see the current version of the IMap entry, not the
version from the time when the query was started.

## INSERT/SINK statement

### Synopsis

```sql
[ INSERT | SINK ] INTO [schema_name.]table_name[(column_name [, ...])]
{ SELECT ... | VALUES(expression, [, ...]) }
```

Jobs that process unbounded streams typically read from some source(s)
and write to a sink. However, writing to the sink doesn't directly map
to SQL commands. A Jet sink isn't limited to only insert or delete rows,
even the SQL standard `MERGE` statement isn't easily applicable.

As a solution, Jet uses the non-standard `SINK INTO` command, whose
semantics depend on the underlying sink connector. Jet takes the output
of the SELECT statement and sends it to the sink to process. For
example, when writing to an IMap, the value associated with the key is
overwritten, and one key can be overwritten multiple times.

Some connectors support the `INSERT INTO` statement. If they do, the
behavior is defined by the SQL standard. For example, the Apache Kafka
connector supports it. Jet doesn't support `DELETE` or `UPDATE`
statements.

### Transactional behavior

In SQL a statement is always atomic. In streaming SQL this is not
possible: since the SQL statement never completes, we will never see any
result. Therefore Jet relaxes the behavior: the sink is free to define
its own transaction semantics. Jet has the option to support fault
tolerance with at-least-once semantics, violating strict atomicity.
Also, if a query fails, you might see partial results written.

## Case sensitivity

Identifiers such as table and column names are case-sensitive. Function
names and SQL keywords aren't. If your identifier contains special
characters, use `"` to quote. For example, if your map is named
`my-map`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM "my-map";  -- works
sElEcT * from "my-map";  -- works
SELECT * FROM my-map;    -- fails, `-` interpreted as subtraction
SELECT * FROM "MY-MAP";  -- fails, map name is case-sensitive
```
