description: Description of the SQL Apache Kafka connector

The Apache Kafka connector supports reading and writing to Apache Kafka
topics.

Apache Kafka is schema-less, however SQL assumes a schema. We assume all
messages in a topic are of the same type (with some exceptions). Kafka
also supports several serialization options, see below.

## Serialization options

To work with Kafka, you must specify the `keyFormat` and `valueFormat`
options. Currently, even if you create a table mapping explicitly, we
can't resolve these. These are the supported values for `keyFormat` and
`valueFormat`:

* `avro`
* `json`
* `java`

The key and value format can be different. Any options not recognized by
Jet are passed directly to the Kafka producer or consumer. See the
examples for individual serialization options below.

### Avro Serialization

When using Avro, Jet reads the fields from the `GenericRecord` returned
by the `KafkaAvroDeserializer`. When inserting to a topic, we create an
ad-hoc Avro schema named `jet.sql` from the mapping columns. Jet
currently can't use your custom Avro schema to create objects, but it
can use it to read objects written through our ad-hoc schema, as long as
the field names/types match.

#### Mapping Between SQL and Avro Types

| SQL Type | Avro Type |
| - | - |
| `TINYINT`<br/>`SMALLINT`<br/>`INT` | `INT` |
| `BIGINT` | `LONG` |
| `REAL` | `FLOAT` |
| `DOUBLE` | `DOUBLE` |
| `BOOLEAN` | `BOOLEAN` |
| `VARCHAR`<br/>and all other types | `STRING` |

All Avro types are a union of the `NULL` type and the actual type.

```sql
CREATE MAPPING my_topic (
)
TYPE Kafka
OPTIONS (
    keyFormat 'java',
    keyJavaClass 'java.lang.String',
    valueFormat 'avro',
    "bootstrap.servers" '10.0.1.120',
    "schema.registry.url" 'http://10.0.1.120:58819/'
    "key.serializer" 'org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.LongSerializer',
    "key.deserializer" 'org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.LongDeserializer',
    "value.serializer" 'io.confluent.kafka.serializers.KafkaAvroSerializer',
    "value.deserializer" 'io.confluent.kafka.serializers.KafkaAvroDeserializer',
    "auto.offset.reset" 'earliest'
    /* more Kafka options ... */
)
```

In this example, the key is a plain `Long` number, the value is
avro-serialized. `keyFormat`, `keyJavaClass` and `valueFormat` are
handled by Jet, the rest is passed to Kafka producer or consumer. The
option names containing the `.` must be enclosed in double quotes
because the `.` is a reserved character in SQL, double quotes are used
to quote identifiers: this way the `.` is interpreted literally.

### JSON serialization

You don't have to provide any options for the JSON format, but since
Jet can't automatically determine the column list, you must explitictly
specify it:

```sql
CREATE MAPPING my_topic(
    __key BIGINT,
    ticker VARCHAR,
    amount INT)
TYPE Kafka
OPTIONS (
    keyFormat 'json',
    valueFormat 'json')
```

JSON's type system doesn't match SQL's exactly. For example, JSON
numbers have unlimited precision, but such numbers are typically not
portable. We convert SQL integer and floating-point types into JSON
numbers. We convert the `DECIMAL` type, as well as all temporal types,
to JSON strings.

We don't support the JSON type from the SQL standard. That means you
can't use functions like `JSON_VALUE` or `JSON_QUERY`. If your JSON
documents don't all have the same fields, the usage is limited.

Internally, we store all JSON values in the string form.

### Java Serialization

Java serialization is the last-resort serialization option. It uses the
Java object exactly as `IMap.get()` returns it. You can use it for
objects serialized using the Java serialization or Hazelcast custom
serialization (`DataSerializable` or `IdentifiedDataSerializable`).

For this format you must specify the class name using `keyJavaClass` and
`valueJavaClass` options, for example:

```sql
CREATE MAPPING my_topic
TYPE IMap
OPTIONS (
    keyFormat 'java',
    keyJavaClass 'java.lang.Long',
    valueFormat 'java',
    valueJavaClass 'com.example.Person')
```

If the Java class corresponds to one of the basic data types (numbers,
dates, strings), that type will directly be used for the key or value
and mapped as a column named `__key` for keys and `this` for values. In
the example above, the key will be mapped under the `BIGINT` type.

If the Java class is not one of the basic types, Hazelcast will analyze
the class using reflection and use its properties as column names. It
recognizes public fields and JavaBeans-style getters. If some property
has a non-primitive type, it will be mapped under the `OBJECT` type.

## External Name

You rarely need to specify the columns in DDL. If you do, you might need
to specify the external name.

The entries in a map naturally have _key_ and _value_ elements. Because
of this, the format of the external name must be either `__key.<name>`
for a field in the key or `this.<name>` for a field in the value.

The external name defaults to `this.<columnName>`, so normally you only
need to specify it for key fields. There are also columns that represent
the entire key and value objects, called `__key` and `this`.

## Heterogeneous Messages

If you have messages of different types in your topic, you have to
specify the columns in the `CREATE MAPPING` command. You may specify
columns that don't exist in some messages. If a property doesn't exist
in a specific message instance, the corresponding column value will be
NULL.

For example, let's say you have these messages in your topic:

|key|value|
|-|-|
|1|`{"name":"Alice","age":42}`|
|2|`{"name":"Bob","age":43,"petName":"Zaz"}`|

If you map the column `petName`, it will have the value `null` for the
entry with `key=1`.

The objects in the topic may even use different serialization strategies
without breaking SQL. We'll try to extract the field by name regardless
of the actual serialization format. The serialization you specify in the
mapping is needed only when inserting into that map.

### TODO test this

extract the field by name, regardless of the actual serialization format
encountered at runtime. The specified serialization format will be used
when writing into that topic.
