At Hazelcast we have a policy of supporting a minor version for two years
since the initial release. For Hazelcast Jet 4.5 this period expired at the
end of April, marking an end of Hazelcast Jet as a standalone product.

Since 2021 our Jet engine, a stream processing system that can do 
stateful computations over massive amounts of data with consistent 
low latency, has been part of Hazelcast Platform 5.x.

We encourage every Hazelcast Jet user still using any of the Jet 4.x 
versions to upgrade to Hazelcast 5.x. There are some minor 
incompatibilities in how a Hazelcast instance is started, but e.g. the 
Pipeline API is fully backward compatible. See the 
[upgrade documentation](https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/latest/migrate/upgrading-from-jet) 
for details.
