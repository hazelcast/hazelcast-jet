 * Information pertaining to a single data change event (insertion,

 * (in the case of relational databases) or document (in the case of
 * NoSQL databases).
 * <p>
 * Each event has a <i>key</i>, which identifies the particular
 * record or document being affected, and a <i>value</i>, which
 * describes the actual change itself.
 * <p>
 * Most events have an <i>operation</i> associated with them which
 * specifies the type of change being described (insertion, delete or
 * update). This is really a property of the value, it's only replicated
 * at this level for convenience. Only some special events, like
 * heartbeats don't have an operation value.
 * <p>
 * There is also a <i>timestamp</i> which specifies the moment in time when
 * the event happened. This timestamp is "real" in the sense that it
 * comes from the database change-log, so it's not "processing time",
 * it's not the moment when the event was observed by our system. Keep
 * in mind though that not all events come from the change-log. The
 * change-log goes back in time only to a limited extent, all older
 * events are parts of a database snapshot constructed when we start
 * monitoring the database and their timestamps are accordingly
 * artificial. Identifying snapshot events is possible most of the time,
 * because their operation will be {@link Operation#SYNC} instead of
 * {@link Operation#INSERT} (one notable exception being MySQL).
