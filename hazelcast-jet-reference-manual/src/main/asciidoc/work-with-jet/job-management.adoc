= Jet Command Line Tool

Jet comes with a command line tool, `jet.sh` which you can use to submit
jobs and do basic management of their lifecycle. It supports these
commands:

[%header]
|===
|Command|Description
|`cluster`|Shows current cluster state and information about members
|`list-jobs`|Lists running jobs on the cluster
|`submit`|Submits a job to the cluster
|`cancel`|Cancels a running job
|`suspend`|Suspends a running job
|`resume`|Resumes a suspended job
|`restart`|Restarts a running job
|`list-snapshots`|Lists saved snapshots on the cluster
|`save-snapshot`|Saves a named snapshot from a job (Jet Enterprise only)
|`delete-snapshot`|Deletes a named snapshot
|===

The command line uses the Jet client under the hood and thus needs to be
configured with connection information to the cluster. By default,
the command line tools uses the `hazelcast-client.xml` found in the
`config` path of the distribution. It's also possible to specify
connection parameters explicitly. For example, to list all the
jobs running on the cluster you can use the following command:

....
bin/jet.sh -a 192.168.0.1:5701,192.168.0.1:5702 -g my-group list-jobs
....

This command would try to connect to either `192.168.0.1:5701`
or `192.168.0.2:5702` using group name `my-group` and will list
all the running jobs on the cluster. If you want to use the tool
with a different `client.xml` you can do it as follows:

....
bin/jet.sh -f client.xml list-jobs
....

For more details on how to use the command line tool please refer to its own
documentation which can be retrieved by the command `jet.sh --help`

[[management-center]]
= Management Center

Hazelcast Jet Management Center is a management and monitoring suite providing
a live overview of the Hazelcast Jet cluster.
Management Center includes a tool for diagnosing data flow within the
running Hazelcast Jet job. It provides a visualization of the computational
stages and allows you to peek into the stats across the data flow graph
enabling you to diagnose bottlenecks.

Please refer to the {jet-mc-refman}[Hazelcast Jet Management Center Reference Manual]
for installation and usage instructions.
