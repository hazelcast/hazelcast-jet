[[watermark-policy]]
= Watermark Policy

As mentioned in the
<<time-ordering>> chapter, determining the watermark is somewhat of a black art; it's
about superimposing order over a disordered stream of events. We must
decide at which point it stops making sense to wait even longer for data
about past events to arrive. There's a tension between two opposing
forces here:

- wait as long as possible to account for all the data;
- get results as soon as possible.

While there are ways to (kind of) achieve both, there's a significant
associated cost in terms of complexity and overall performance. Hazelcast
Jet takes a simple approach and strictly triages stream items into
"`still on time`" and "`late`", discarding the latter.

{jet-javadoc}/core/WatermarkPolicy.html[`WatermarkPolicy`]
is the abstraction that computes the value of the watermark for a
(sub)stream of disordered data items. It takes as input the timestamp of
each observed item and outputs the current watermark value.

== Predefined Watermark Policy

We provide a simple, data-agnostic watermark policy, the
{jet-javadoc}/core/WatermarkPolicy.html#limitingLag-long-[`limitingLag()`]
policy. This policy will maintain a watermark that lags behind the
highest observed event timestamp by a configured amount. In other words,
each time an event with the highest timestamp so far is encountered,
this policy advances the watermark to `eventTimestamp - lag`. This puts
a limit on the spread between timestamps in the stream: all events whose
timestamp is more than the configured `lag` behind the highest timestamp
are considered late.

[[watermark-throttling]]
== Watermark Throttling

The policy objects presented above will return the "`ideal`" watermark
value according to their logic; however it would be too much overhead to
insert a watermark item each time the ideal watermark advances
(typically every millisecond). The
{jet-javadoc}/core/EventTimePolicy.html#watermarkThrottlingFrameSize--[`EventTimePolicy.watermarkThrottlingFrameSize()`]
and
{jet-javadoc}/core/EventTimePolicy.html#watermarkThrottlingFrameOffset--[`EventTimePolicy.watermarkThrottlingFrameOffset()`]
are the parameters that control the watermark interval.

Since the watermark is only needed for windowing aggregation, we can
emit only those watermarks, that will cause a new window to be emitted.
In case of sliding windows, the _throttling frame size_ and _offset_
should correspond to the sliding step and frame offset of the sliding
window. Session windows can emit windows at any moment, using high
_throttling frame size_ will increase latency as the event time only
advances with the arrival of a newer watermark. For session window in
the Pipeline API, we use 100ms as the _throttling frame size_ or less,
if the session timeout is short.
